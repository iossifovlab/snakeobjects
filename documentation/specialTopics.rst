Working with clusters
=====================

``Snakeobjects`` provides transparent access to different cluster architectures
such as ``slurm``, ``SGE``, and others. This is accomplished by placing cluster
profile path into ``so_project.yaml`` file with the name
``default_snakemake_args`` as in this example:

.. code-block::

   default_snakemake_args: --profile <path to profile folder>

Profile folder should contain file ``config.yaml`` with directives specific to
cluster architecture. For more information on profiles see
https://github.com/snakemake-profiles/doc.  

Multi-part targets
==================

Sometimes target computing time exceeds several hours or even days. This
negatively affects overall project management: unstable file system,
failure of computational node, or many other causes may delay processing
downstream targets. With multiple processing units it may be valuable to split
a target into sub-targets. In bioinformatics it is convenient to restrict bam
file processing by extracting data for individual chromosomes and then
accumulating partial results in a separate target. In ``snakeobjects`` we have
special functions that make subdivision of a target into smaller ones with
the following aggregation of these parts into original target easy to
accomplish. Below is an example.

.. code-block:: python

    ids = list_of_part_ids

    rule beg:
	  output:
        T('beg-{c}.txt')
      shell:
        "initialize.sh {wildcards.oid} {wildcards.c} > {output}"

    rule part:
      input:
        T('beg-{c}.txt')
      output:
        T('part-{c}.txt')
      shell:
        "process_part.sh {wildcards.oid} {wildcards.c} > {output}; "

    rule mergedI:
      input:
        expand(TE('part-{c}.txt'),c=ids)
      output:
        T('merged.txt')
      shell: 
        "merge_parts.sh {input} > {output}"

Here initialize.sh, process_part.sh, and merge_parts.sh are appropriate
commands user should provide for his/her application. They are not restricted
to shell codes, but can be python scripts or other executables. More specific
simple examples are presented in demos/d5 and demos/d8.  The important element
in this implementation is function :py:func:`.TE`.
